## Description

You can use this plugin to create floating text. If you choose dynamic text, everyone can see different information. All variables come from [BEPlaceHolderAPI](https://github.com/LiteLDev/BEPlaceholderAPI/releases/) (you can use "/placeholder info" to see them).

The default language of the plugin is Chinese, you can change it to your language by rewriting the language file (plugins/Hologram/lang.json).

When creating a floating text, the length of the string allowed in the input box of the GUI interface may not be enough. You can modify the content of your floating text in the data file (plugins/Hologram/data.json) after creating it.

Atention: Before you use this plugin, you need to add the pre-plugin [BEPlaceHolderAPI](https://github.com/LiteLDev/BEPlaceholderAPI/releases/), if you don't, the dynamic floating texts will not work.
